Just python scripts:

extractToJson.py to convert to JSON:
_file have to be "example.txt" and it's a copy/paste from utc text schedule

utc_to_google_calendar.py to convert to CSV or ICAL:
_modify in the last line: toical() for ICAL or tocsv() for CSV
_depending on the semester and years and all the stuff, you have to params the script with some global at the head of the script (start_year,...)

Good luck and don't hesitate to email me
